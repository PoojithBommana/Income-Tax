# Income-Tax
This code calculates the income tax you need to pay based on your annual income. It follows these steps:

You input your annual income.

It subtracts 50,000 from your income to account for deductions.

If your income is less than or equal to 250,000, your tax is 0.

If your income falls between 250,000 and 500,000, you pay 5% tax on the amount over 250,000.

If your income is between 500,000 and 750,000, you pay 10% tax on the amount over 500,000 plus 5% of 250,000.

If your income is between 750,000 and 1,000,000, you pay 15% tax on the amount over 750,000 plus 10% of 250,000 and 5% of 250,000.

If your income is between 1,000,000 and 1,250,000, you pay 20% tax on the amount over 1,000,000, 10% of 250,000, 5% of 250,000, and 15% of 250,000.

If your income is between 1,250,000 and 1,500,000, you pay 25% tax on the amount over 1,250,000, 10% of 250,000, 5% of 250,000, 15% of 250,000, and 20% of 250,000.

If your income is above 1,500,000, you pay 30% tax on the amount over 1,500,000, 10% of 250,000, 5% of 250,000, 15% of 250,000, 20% of 250,000, and 25% of 250,000.

The code calculates the tax amount based on these rules and prints the result for your income level.
